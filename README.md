# Welcome to the Minecraft Bedrock Editor! 

< insert gif of the Editor here > 

Minecraft Editor is a natively built, multiblock editing experience focused on making it possible for creators of all skillsets to easily craft high-quality experiences in Bedrock. 

Editor is in early development and there is still a lot of work our small team has ahead of us. It will be exclusively available in Bedrock Preview until the feature set and quality meets our standards to be made visible in Retail and the Launcher.

Our mission with the Editor is to build a strong, basic experience, inclusive of a framework that makes it extensible and customizable. We are building an Editor API, and while we have iterations to the core Editor experience we want to make, we are also focused on unlocking functionality via the API for you to build your own Editor Extensions. In releases to come, we will make our early iteration of the API visible, however for now we invite you to acquaint yourself with the existing [scripting](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/minecraft/creator/scriptapi/) efforts. Languages to brush up on for using the Editor API: JavaScript and Typescript. 

## Accessing the Editor
Bedrock Editor is for Windows PC, keyboard + mouse only. Three-step quick start for getting the Editor: 

1. Install Bedrock Preview via the Launcher. 
2. Create a desktop shortcut. When prompted for the filename, copy/paste the following into the textfield: `minecraft:?Editor=true`
3. Open the Editor via the desktop shortcut you created.
