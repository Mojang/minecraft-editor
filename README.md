# Welcome to the Minecraft Bedrock Editor! 

< insert gif of the Editor here > 

Minecraft Editor is a natively built, multiblock editing experience focused on making it possible for creators of all skillsets to easily craft high-quality experiences in Bedrock. 

Editor is in early development and there is still a lot of work our team has ahead of us. It will be exclusively available in Bedrock Preview until the feature set and quality meets our standards to be made visible in the Launcher.

The goal is to make the Editor open source, and this is the repo where we will host that. We are still shaping the specifics of how we will be open-sourcing, but we have been building with that in mind and will be starting with extensions that leverage [scripting](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/minecraft/creator/scriptapi/).

## Accessing the Editor
Bedrock Editor is for Windows PC, keyboard + mouse only. Three-step quick start for getting the Editor: 

1. Install Bedrock Preview via the Launcher. 
2. Create a desktop shortcut. When prompted for the filename, copy/paste the following into the textfield: `minecraft:?Editor=true`
3. Open the Editor via the desktop shortcut you created.
