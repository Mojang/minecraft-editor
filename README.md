# Welcome to the Minecraft Bedrock Editor! 

< insert gif of the Editor here > 

Minecraft Editor is a natively built, multiblock editing experience focused on making it possible for creators of all skillsets to easily craft high-quality experiences in Bedrock. 

## Housekeeping
- Editor will be exclusively available in Bedrock Preview until the feature set and quality meets our standards to be made visible in Retail and the Launcher.
- Editor is not a new gamemode, and actively being made to be intentionally distinct from Creative, Survival, and Adventure gamemodes. 

## Development
We are in early development and there is still a lot of work our small team has ahead of us. In line with our principles, we want to share early and often with you, and develop alongside our creator community ❤️! Because we are such a small team, our speed to make changes you suggest might be a bit slow, but we are eager for your feedback and want to work with you to iterate!

## Extensibility
Our mission with the Editor is to build a strong, basic experience, inclusive of a framework that makes it extensible and customizable. We are building an Editor API, and while we have iterations to the core Editor experience we want to make, we are also focused on unlocking functionality via the API for you to build your own editing tools -- which we are calling "extensions."

In releases to come, we will make our initial iteration of the Editor API visible. However, for now we invite you to acquaint yourself with the existing [scripting](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/minecraft/creator/scriptapi/) efforts. The Editor exists because of scripting, and there will be a *ton* of possibilities with what we're unlocking in the Editor API with what scripting is enabling for general Bedrock. 

_Note:_ Scripting is actively transitioning out of Experimental, which means in order to have a cohesive experience in your explorations, enable the "Beta APIs" toggle in Experiments when creating a new world. We also encourage you to brush up on Javascript and Typescript, as that will be what extensions are written in. 

## Accessing the Editor
Bedrock Editor will be for Windows PC, keyboard + mouse only. Three-step quick start for getting the Editor: 

1. Install Bedrock Preview via the [Launcher](https://help.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/articles/4412261881229-Minecraft-Launcher-for-Windows-).
2. Create a desktop shortcut. When prompted for the filename, copy/paste the following into the textfield: `minecraft:?Editor=true`
3. Open the Editor via the desktop shortcut you created.
